# Proposals
In an effort to establish standards and practices that improve the open podcasting ecosystem for both listeners and creators, we will pursue specific proposals through open collaboration.

## [PSP-1: Podcast RSS Specification](https://github.com/Podcast-Standards-Project/PSP-1-Podcast-RSS-Specification)
A living standard for podcast RSS feeds.

Our first initiative is centered around establishing a baseline standard for podcast RSS feeds. Think of this as the table stakes for anyone building podcast tech. 

Services that build or ingest RSS feeds should support the same standard set of elements. This allows podcast hosting companies and listening applications to build in the same direction, knowing that standard element support will exist on both sides. To this end, we ask all podcast hosting companies and podcast player apps to fully support these core standards before adding product-specific innovations.

This living standard is intended to evolve over time and facilitate innovation.
