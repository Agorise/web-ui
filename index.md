## The Podcast Standards Project (PSP) exists to advocate for and protect open podcasting.
Since the first podcast feed was created, podcasting has been a bit rebellious; a wild child. The simplicity of combining RSS with media files granted a worldwide broadcast license to anyone with basic recording gear and an Internet connection.

In June 2005, Apple created the iTunes namespace. This RSS extension gave podcasters the elements needed to accurately describe their podcasts and the associated episodes. While this helped accelerate the adoption of podcasting, it also placed a lot of control in the hands of one, commercially motivated, entity. This rarely updated namespace still empowers and limits open podcasting today.

As podcasting continues to grow in popularity, podcasters are hungry for innovation but very much stuck at the mercy of Apple. As other large entities entered the space the hope was that the competition would facilitate advancement. Instead, the most serious challengers are pursuing closed-platform approaches by adopting proprietary technology and abandoning RSS in the name of innovation.

The truth is that no one can kill open podcasting. Anyone with a microphone and an Internet connection will always be able to spin up a feed and broadcast to the world. But much in the same way that closed social feeds replaced open blogs, podcasting faces a similar assault today.

This is the landscape that has birthed The Podcast Standards Project, a grassroots coalition working to establish modern, open standards, to enable innovation in the podcast industry.

This is an open project and we're calling upon all of the rebellious and wild children of podcasting for support. Check out our proposals and join the movement to keep podcasting open.
